Jackson Heim's audio visualizer notes:

AUDIO AFFECTS
The audio affect nodes I used were the highself filter, lowshelf filter, and distrotion.
The highshelf and lowshelf filters can be turned on and off with the treble and bass checkboxes respectively.
The distortion node can be turned on and off with the distortion checkbox and the level of distrotion can be changed with the slider.


SPRITES
Used the phylloclassy sprite as a basis for making the fireworks that grow and fade with the music.
Made a sprite for triangles that rotate with the music.

APP DATA
Used a json file to load in the app page title and the information at the top of the box. 
The information inclued the title, the list of songs available, and instructions for how to use the app.
