Jackson Heim's audio visualizer notes:

AUDIO AFFECTS
The audio affect nodes I used were the highself filter, lowshelf filter, and distrotion.
The highshelf and lowshelf filters can be turned on and off with the treble and bass checkboxes respectively.
The distortion node can be turned on and off with the distortion checkbox and the level of distrotion can be changed with the slider.
